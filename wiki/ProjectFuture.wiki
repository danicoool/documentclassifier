= Introduction =

After some months of work, I decided I'm going to finish development of this project.
As of now it provides good functionalities, it's in good state of completeness, and I'm quite proud of it, but I have to start working on my Master Thesis, and beside this I prefer to move to other fields of Computer Science (Security, Distributed Systems, P2P networks, etc..).
I hope someone will find it useful.

= Details =
If someone wants to improve it, he/she is welcome, and can do it under the terms of the GPLv3, but there won't be anymore updates on the code from me.
For example, it would be nice to
  # Parallelize classification, either using multithreading, and/or using Java libraries for Grid computing (have a look at GridGain: http://www.gridgain.com/)
  # Insert support for 2D or 3D visualization of the document's histograms, and/or of the TF-IDF vectors in the VSM, using libraries such as:
    * http://www.javaview.de/
    * http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/
    * http://www.softwarefx.com/sfxJavaProducts/CFXforJava/
  # Calculate the centers of each category of the training set (for example, by calculating the average of its documents' histograms), and then perform ranking not against the N training set's documents, but against its M categories' centers. This should provide the following benefits:
    # Better performances (tipically M<<N)
    # Less susceptibleness to outliers
