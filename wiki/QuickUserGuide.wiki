= Execution =
There are two ways to execute the program:
  # Open the file '_DocumentClassifier.jar_', in the subdirectory '_dist_' of program's main directory.
  # Open the main program's directory with Netbeans (menu "File"->"Open Project"), and click on the menu item "Run"->"Run Main Project".
By default the program expects to see the training set in a subdirectory named 'TrainingSet' in the program's main directory. Otherwise, it must be specified through the preferences panel (menu "Modify"->"Preferences...").
